###### **HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY IS A MEDICAL TREATMENT WHICH ENHANCES THE BODY'S NATURAL HEALING PROCESSES BY INHALATION OF 100% OXYGEN IN A TOTAL BODY CHAMBER, WHERE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IS INCREASED AND CONTROLLED. IT IS USED FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF TREATMENTS USUALLY AS PART OF AN OVERALL MEDCIAL CARE PLAN.UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, OXYGEN IS TRANSPORTED THROUGHOUT THE BODY ONLY BY RED BLOOD CELLS. WITH HBOT, OXYGEN IS DISSOLVED INTO ALL OF THE BODY'S FLUIDS, THE PLASMA, THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM FLUIDS, THE LYMPH, AND THE BONE AND CAN BE CARRIED TO AREAS WHERE CIRCULATION IS DIMINISHED OR BLOCKED.IN THIS WAY, EXTRA OXYGEN CAN REACH ALL OF THE DAMAGED TISSUES AND THE BODY CAN SUPPORT ITS OWN HEALING PROCESS. THE INCREASED OXYGEN GREATLY ENHANCES THE ABILITY OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS TO KILL BACTERIA, REDUCES SWELLING AND ALLOWS NEW BLOOD VESSELS TO GROW MORE RAPIDLY**

###### **IT IS A SIMPLE, NON-INVASIVE TREATMENT.**
